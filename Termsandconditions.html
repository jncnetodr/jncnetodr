<br><br>
IX. Membership
<br><br>
A. Registration
<br><br>
You are responsible for providing all equipment and the computer necessary to access the Sites. You may access the non-public portion of any Site only by being a member in good standing to that Site. You may become a member of a Site by completing an online registration form. Upon submission of the online registration form, Network or its authorized agent will process the application. In connection with completing the online registration form, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete at all times while you are a member. You must promptly inform Network of all changes, including, but not limited to, changes in your address and changes in your credit card used in connection with billing for the Sites. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Network or any of its authorized agents have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Network has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site or Sites.
<br><br>
B. Member Account, Password and Security
<br><br>
As part of the registration process, you will select a unique user name and password which you must provide in order to gain access to the non-public portion of a Site. You represent and warrant that you will not disclose to any other person your unique user name and password and that you will not provide access to any Site to anyone who is below the age of majority in your state. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password. Network will not release your password for security reasons. You agree to (a) immediately notify Network of any unauthorized use of your user name and password or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. You are liable and responsible for any unauthorized use of the Sites under your account until you notify Network by email regarding such unauthorized use. Unauthorized access to the Sites is illegal and a breach of this Agreement. You may obtain access to your billing records regarding charges of your use of the Sites upon request as required by law. You may be first required to provide information sufficient to confirm the applicable account belongs to you.
<br><br>
C. Fees
<br><br>
You agree to pay all membership fees when due according to the billing terms. Network posts the current membership fees for each Site as part of the registration process. Network reserves the right to change any Site's membership fees at any time, with or without prior notice to you. At the time of registration, you must select a payment method. Network reserves the right to contract with a third party to process all payments. Such third party may impose additional terms and conditions governing payment processing. Your account will be deemed past due if it is not paid in full by the payment due date. If your account becomes past due, you agree to pay interest on the past due amount at a monthly rate of 1.5%, or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower, compounded daily, plus any additional collection costs, credits, charge backs and attorney's fees. Your card issuer agreement may contain additional terms with respect to your rights and liabilities as a card holder. You are responsible for reimbursing Network for all credit card charge backs, dishonored checks and any related charges. You authorize Network and its agents to make payments for the services provided to you through the Sites by automatic check debit and credit card on your behalf. You hereby agree not to falsely report the credit card or check card lost or stolen, without good reason that it is lost or stolen, that you have used for payment of Network's goods or services, including subscriptions. Such fraudulent reporting to avoid payment for goods or services that you or anyone under your authority has made to Network or the Sites when you have an outstanding charge to Network shall make you liable to Network for $25,000 in liquidated damages. This liability for liquidated damages is in addition to any other liability you may incur for breaches of any other Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
<br><br>
D. Billing Errors
<br><br>
If you believe that you have been erroneously billed, please notify us immediately of such error. If we do not hear from you within thirty (30) days after such billing error first appears on any account statement, such fee will be deemed acceptable by you for all purposes, including resolution of inquiries made by your credit card issuer.
<br><br>
E. Refund Policy
<br><br>
Network does not provide cash refunds. We do, however, grant credits in the form of free monthly memberships to resolve customer service issues. The billing system used by Network or our authorized agents provides extensive credit card fraud protection measures and our Sites include many features to protect users from accidental charges. Therefore, refunds to your credit card will be provided only under the rarest of circumstances such as persistent technical problems originating with our equipment.
<br><br>
F. Download Limit
<br><br>
We reserve the right to restrict the amount of Materials which may be downloaded by your account at any time.
<br><br>
X. Termination

You may cancel your membership at any time through the third party who is processing your fees. Links to these third party processors are located in the customer service area within the non-public portion of the website. Otherwise you may cancel your membership by providing: (a) our customer service department with a notice of your intent to cancel the membership at least 48 hours before the renewal date along with your user name and password; and (b) any outstanding fees owed for your membership. You hereby agree to be personally liable for any and all charges made by you for goods or services through your use of the Sites. This Agreement's provisions shall survive its termination, unless otherwise stated. Upon our processing of your request to cancel your membership, you will no longer have access to the non-public areas of the Site or Sites to which you were a member.

Network may terminate your access to a Site at any time, with or without advance notice, if: (a) Network believes that you have breached any material term of these Terms and Conditions, (b) if you fail to pay any amount due by the payment due date; or (c) Network decides to cease operations or to otherwise discontinue any of the Sites. Further, you agree that neither Network nor any third party acting on our behalf shall be liable to you for any termination of your membership or access to any of the Sites.

XVII. Export Control

With respect to purchases being made through United States based payment processors, You understand and acknowledge that the software elements of the Materials on the Sites may be subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Government, including the U.S. Department of Commerce, which prohibits export or diversion of software to certain countries and third parties.

XVIII. General Provisions

A. Governing Law

With respect to purchasers located in the United States, who have United States citizenship or other legal status in the United States and/or users whose purchases are made through United States payment processors (“US Users”) these Terms and Conditions and all matters arising out of or otherwise relating to these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, excluding its conflict of law provisions. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to these Terms and Conditions. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the State of Florida. Exclusive venue for any litigation or arbitration permitted under this Agreement shall be with the state and federal courts located in Miami-Dade County, Florida. With respect to all users who are not US Users, these Terms and Conditions and all matters arising out of or otherwise relating to these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to these Terms and Conditions. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in the Czech Republic. Exclusive venue for any litigation or arbitration permitted under this Agreement shall be with the courts located in the Czech Republic.

B. Rights to Injunctive Relief

Both parties acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to provide an aggrieved party with full compensation in the event of the other party's breach, and that an aggrieved party shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief in the event of any such breach, in addition to seeking all other remedies available at law or in equity.

C. Arbitration

All Disputes (including any dispute relating to the arbitrability of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement or any other dispute relating to arbitration) must be submitted to arbitration before and in accordance with the arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules. The term “Dispute” means any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site or the Services or this Agreement, or any breach thereof, including any claim that this Agreement, or any part of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or otherwise voidable or void.

The provisions of this Arbitration Section must be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement; provided that if a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator determines that any such provisions are unlawful in any way, such court or arbitrator is to modify or interpret such provisions to the minimum extent necessary to have them comply with the law. With respect to US Users, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement relating to under which state’s laws this Agreement is to be governed by and construed under, all issues relating to arbitrability or the enforcement of the Agreement to arbitrate contained herein are to be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) and the federal common law of arbitration.

With respect to all users, Judgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction and will be binding, final and non-appealable. You and Network hereby waive to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that in the event of a dispute between them, each shall be limited to the recovery of any actual damages sustained by it.

This arbitration provision is self-executing and will remain in full force and effect after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. In the event either party fails to appear at any properly noticed arbitration proceeding, an award may be entered against such party by default or otherwise notwithstanding said failure to appear.

With respect to US Users, arbitration shall take place in the Miami-Dade County, Florida, exclusively. With respect to all other users, arbitration shall take place in the Czech Republic, exclusively. With respect to all users, You and Network hereby agree that no action (whether for arbitration, damages, injunctive, equitable or other relief, including rescission) will be maintained by any party to enforce any liability or obligation of the other party, whether arising from this Agreement or otherwise, or any other Dispute, unless brought before the expiration of the earlier of one year from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claims or within 90 days from either the actual discovery of the facts giving rise to such claims or from the date on which the party should have, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, discovered such facts.

The obligation to arbitrate is not binding upon Network with respect to claims relating to its trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, or other intellectual- property rights, or requests for temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions or other procedures in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain interim relief when deemed necessary by such court to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable injury pending resolution by arbitration of the actual dispute between the parties.

The prevailing party will be entitled to receive from the non-prevailing party its costs relating to the arbitration proceeding including but not limited to, the arbitrator's fees, attorneys' fees and costs, witness fees, transcription fees, etc. and sales and use taxes thereon, if any.

You and Network each acknowledges and agrees that it is the intent of the parties that arbitration and litigation between the parties will be of the parties' individual claims, and that none of their respective claims may be arbitrated or litigated on a class-wide basis.

D. Assignment

The rights and liabilities of the parties hereto will bind and inure to the benefit of their respective assignees, successors, executors, and administrators, as the case may be. Neither these Terms and Conditions nor any rights granted hereunder may be sold, leased, assigned or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part by you.

E. Severability

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator finds any provision of these Terms and Conditions, or any portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions will continue in full force and effect.

F. Attorney's Fees

In the event of any litigation arising out of this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorney's fees, including attorney's fees incurred on appeal.

G. No Waiver

No waiver of Network shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent default of the same provision of these Terms and Conditions. If any term, clause or provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other term, clause or provision and such invalid term, clause or provision shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms and Conditions.

H. Headings

All headings are solely for the convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning, construction or effect of these Terms and Conditions.

I. Complete Agreement

Unless accepted by Network in writing, these Terms and Conditions may not be amended by you.

K. Government Rights

The software elements of the Materials have been developed at private expense and are "commercial computer software" or "restricted computer software" within the meaning of the FARs, the DFARs, and any other similar regulations relating to government acquisition of computer software.
